# odin-tictactoe
This is my take on [The Odin Project's Tic Tac Toe assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe).

My objective was to implement a Tic Tac Toe game with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

I made use of [Factory Functions and the IIFE Module pattern](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-factory-functions-and-the-module-pattern) which allowed me to reuse code and experiment with objects that have private properties and functions.
